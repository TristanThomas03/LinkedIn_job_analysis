# LinkedIn pharamceutical industry job analysis
This project was completed as part of my Master 1 in Biostatistics at Paris Cit√©. As a fifth-year Pharmacy student alongside this M1, I wanted to explore the professional ecosystem of the pharmaceutical industry to inform my professional vision.

Job data (hierarchical levels, contract types, required diplomas, etc.) was scraped using Python. The Rmd file provided includes the cleaning, preparation, and analysis of this data.
